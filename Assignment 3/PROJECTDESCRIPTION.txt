PROJECT DESCRIPTION - Assignment 3

This project uses python file extract_words.py to read a txt version of Dracula. The code iterates through each line and, creating distinct dicionaries
that later output allwords.txt, wordfrequency.txt and uniquewords.txt.

allwords.txt stores all words in the text in a seperate line.
wordfrequency.txt stores a the number words with a particular frequency.
uniquewords.txt stores words that only appear in the text once.

All words are in lowercase and stripped of periods, commas and parenthesis.

a3_wordfrequency.pde creates uses squares to create a stacked piramid using the frequency/10 for the width of each layer. This way,
we visually demonstrate how many words have particular frequencies in an interesting and creative way.

a3_novelvisualization.pde makes reads in the uniquewords.txt file and fills a canvas with words, interchanging with different
text formating to create a visually appealing image.

The file also contains a wordle word cloud that visually represents the entire Dracula text.

The team struggled the most with python, considering we had to relearn the language. We also had some challenge reading in the strings,
but once we figured that out, the rest of the assignment came easier. 1234
