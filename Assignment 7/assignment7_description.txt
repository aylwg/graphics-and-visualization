Our game is based on the classic "Snake" game, with some changes. Players control a snake using the arrow keys and try to pick up green dots to grow and 
increase their score, while avoiding red dots which will decrease their score. Although implemented, the size of the snake will never decrease except when 
restarting the game. Players can wrap around the screen by exiting any of sides, but at the cost of losing a point on their score. Players start at 3 points, 
win at 20 points, and lose at 0 points. The snake class is the only class we used, but it controls all aspects of the snake, including movement and collecting
points. 

Audrey created the snake and made it interactive, allowing the snake to wrap around the screen, and created dots that randomly appear on the board. 
Lorena did created the scoreboard system, the starting mode as well as the end mode.
Katherine primarily polished the code, including formatting the graphics and debugging, along with the quit button and getting the point system to work as planned.
