Project Description for group_17_assignment5.pde 

project description text file that summarizes what the intended animation was, 
what the included classes do, and any unexpected challenges. 
That is, this is mostly a rehash of the progress report 
but from the position of what you accomplished rather than what you were planning. 
Also document which group member worked on which part of the assignment. 
While group coding is allowed, each member is responsible for their individual parts 
-- this ensures all group members are participating and have mastery of the assignment.

Lorena worked on sphere classes. The class animates spheres to move from top left corner to bottom right corner of the canvas. Subclasses add more animations such as rotation and color change.
The most dificult part to achieve was pushing and popping matrix in order to display within picture frame.

Pyramid classes - Pyramid displays a pyramid, RotatePyramid rotates based on an incrementing angle which modifies the X- and Y-axes 
and also uses the display function from base Pyramid class, MovePyramid takes the moving pyramid from RotatePyramid and
rotates based on MouseX movement which changes the X-axis.
