Project Description for Assignment 4

The intended animation was a set of hands holding flowers that flow in the wind with an animated background of sunrays. 
The classes are Clouds, Rays, Sun, Flower, Hand, Finger, and Sweater. 
The Flower class takes in two image path names as strings, an optional leaf path name, two sets of x and y coordinates corresponding to the top 
left points of the stem svg and the top left corner of the flower svg, the relative difference of the stem location for each flower 
(because the drawings had stems that weren't centered in the svg), a float that corresponds to the angle of rotation, and loads the svgs from the pathnames. 
The stem is displayed and rotated and the flower is displayed and rotated relative to the stem. To confirm that there is rotation around the secondary point, 
the first rotation for the stem can be commented out, and vice versa. 
The Sun and Hand classes both take in a PShape, and a corresponding x and y coordinate to display the sun/hand in a certain location. 
The Finger class extends the Hand class and rotates a finger svg around a pivot point specified. 
The Sweater class loads shapes from two pathnames, and displays each sweater in the same location based on a counter.
The Ray class loads svgs as PShapes and rotates them around a sun object. One of the PShapes utilizes scaling to pulse while rotating.
The Cloud class takes a speed variable to move the clouds across the screen, and wraps around once the cloud completely exits the canvas. 
Some unexpected challenges were importing svgs properly as they originally loaded as black shapes, and figuring out how to properly 
translate, rotate, and determine pivot points of rotation. 

Parts:
Audrey - Flower class, implemented sound file
Katherine - Sun, Rays, Clouds classes
Lorena - Hand, Finger, Sweater classes, and created svgs
